<h1 id="event-processor">Event Processor</h1>

<p>The event processor is used to get event information from web sites
 (by &quot;scraping&quot;). It is a Python codebase built on the <code>scrapy</code>
package, then packaged up with Docker.</p>

<p>This file contains my notes from reading all of the contents of the
event processor directory, including notes about particular code or
coding styles used. I have also estimated the complexity of the code,
using one (1) to represent very simple and three (3) to represent
&quot;beginning to get complex enough to have real mistakes&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-variables">Configuration Variables</h2>

<p>These from <code>config.py</code>. Annotating where they are used and what they
do. (Complexity = 1)</p>

<ul>
<li><code>config.spider_name</code>: Activate the one named spider. None activates
all! (runner.py).</li>
<li><code>config.debug</code>: Activates Python Tools for Visual Studio remote
debugging server in runner.py.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: <code>self.verbose_scrapy_output</code> is set twice.</p>

<h2 id="top-level">Top Level</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>runner.py</code>: Loads configuration and runs spiders. Complexity = 2.</p></li>

<li><p><code>create_schedules.py</code>: Schedule spider jobs. Complexity = 3.</p>

<p>Includes <code>Schedule</code> class. It would be useful if the meaning of
 the parameters for this class were documented. Especially
 &quot;interval&quot;, &quot;delta&quot; and &quot;offset&quot;.
 Use of format strings in <code>__init__</code> seems strange -
 these need tests to make sure they are working as expected. I
 think the author expects math to be done where only substitution
 is occurring in the f-strings.</p>

<p>Includes debugging support, snake case conversion, enabled spider
 selection (no use of environment variable?). Does not actually do
 work, interacts with the &quot;ndscheduler&quot; service. Given how little
 it does, this file seems quite complex.</p></li>

<li><p><code>entrypoint.sh</code></p>

<p>There is a bunch of removing at the start. Why?</p>

<p>Looks like it does two things, depending on the value of
 the <code>RUN_SCHEDULER</code> environment variable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Value of &quot;1&quot;
creates schedules and then runs <code>scrapyd-deploy</code>, then wait
forever.</p></li>

<li><p>Otherwise execute <code>runner.py</code>, which appears to run spider(s)
 without any delay or repeated schedule.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTES: This kind of behavior should be documented (or avoided!).</p></li>

<li><p><code>runner.py</code></p>

<p>Run spider(s) immediately. Can use <code>config.spider_name</code> to run
just one.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="top-level-misc-configuration-files">Top Level Misc Configuration Files</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>nodemon.json</code>: Configures <code>nodemon</code> to auto-reload your Node.js app
when the files on disk are changed.</p></li>

<li><p><code>package.json</code>: For the event processor app.</p></li>

<li><p><code>requirements.txt</code>: For Python.</p></li>

<li><p><code>settings.py</code>: Config for Scapy. Includes cache (controlled by
another config). Sets up scapy log fomatter and log level. Includes
scrapers and apis directories.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="apis">apis</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>greatlakes_ical</code>: Complexity = 1.</p></li>

<li><p><code>honeycomb</code>: The Honeycomb Project. Complexity = 1.</p>

<p>Observed site (not us) eliminating apparently open project when asked for
only &quot;open&quot; events. Investigate.</p></li>

<li><p><code>ical_reader</code>: Complexity = 1.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Has some TODO notes about Unicode. I would like to see tests to
   make sure timestamps are correct based on some real site's data.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>library_events</code>: Chicago Public Library. WORKING HERE FIXME TODO.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="base">base</h2>

<p>Scrapy.spiders.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>aggregator_base.py</code>: AggregatorBase class. Complexity = 4.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>is_errored</code>: any logged message has level <code>ERROR</code>. See notes
below. (!)</p></li>

<li><p>Includes debugging attachment code.</p></li>

<li><p>Remembers date format.</p></li>

<li><p><code>formatter</code> class variable for logging formatter.</p></li>

<li><p>Local <code>start_date</code> variable set to now. (!)</p></li>

<li><p>Local <code>end_date</code> variable set to one month in the future. (!)</p></li>

<li><p>Converted into instance variable</p></li>

<li><p>Configures loggers.</p></li>

<li><p>Action: <code>notify_spider_complete</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Question: memory handler vs stream handler for log. I think the
logging handlers are misconfigured - the memory handler is
supposed to wrap the stream handler, and the stream handler is
supposed to send the output somewhere (it defaults to
stderr).</p></li>

<li><p>Note: creation of a MemoryHandler that buffers 0 log messages
does not seem to make sense. That flushes every time it checks
to see if it is supposed to flush (no buffering). See
<a href="https://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Lib/logging/handlers.py">BufferHandler source code</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>NOTE: The use of the <code>buffer</code> attribute of a <code>MemoryHandler</code> seems
like a bad idea. It's not in the documented interface. Just keep
track of &quot;fatal&quot; errors yourself. (Should be in one place,
right?) (!)</p></li>

<li><p>NOTE: I think setting the time in the constructor is
wrong. Constructors should not do &quot;work&quot; as a rule. Do you
really want the time the spider was made (vs when it ran)?</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><code>api_base.py</code>: ApiBase, which inherits from
AggregatorBase. Complexity = 2.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>parse_response_json</code>: Deliberately choose not to return a
list when there is one element? Doesn't that choice make other
things more confusing? Always need to check return type to
use.</li>
<li><code>get_response_json</code>: Same behavior, uses parse response json.</li>
<li><code>get_response_graphql</code>: Run a GraphQL query.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><code>custom_spiders.py</code>: Skeleton <code>ApiSpider</code>, <code>ScraperSpider</code>,
<code>ScraperCrawlSpider</code> classes. Complexity = 1.</p></li>

<li><p><code>spider_base.py</code>: Complexity = 2 (only because of comments below,
could be 1).</p>

<ul>
<li><code>extract_multiple</code>: Is this tested? type of <code>name_funcs</code> appears
to be <code>Dict: Unknown -&gt; (name, func)</code> because you are iterating
over <code>name_funcs.values()</code>. Should the iteration be
over <code>name_funcs.items()</code>? Yes, that's the way it's used in
the Great Lakes spider.</li>
<li>Understanding this code requires knowing the internal format
of the data you expect to receive. (E.g., what is the need for
the xpath selector function, and the meaning of the
complicated-looking paths in <code>wpbcc_spider.py</code>.</li>
<li><code>create_time_data</code> appears to use the &quot;first&quot; keyword args
value. Order keywords appear in should not matter? I think
this function should use <code>*args</code> not <code>**kwargs</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scrapers">scrapers</h2>

<ul>
<li>greatlakes: Obsolete.</li>

<li><p>history: ChicagoHistory.org.</p>

<p>Uses spider's start and end date.</p></li>

<li><p>wpbcc: Wicker Park - Bucktown Chamber of Commerce. Visible Complexity = 1.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(Extraction functions require understanding of HTML format, so
  complexity = 2 if you want to understand everything that happens.)</p>

<p>Uses class variables, note especially <code>rules</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Investigate whether this produces useful results. The Wicker
  Park/Bucktown web site has many events on the calendar, but few seem
  like suitable events for volunteering.</p>

<h3 id="scrapy-impl">scrapy impl</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>middlewares: Count events and process. Complexity = 1.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is it important that the counts be the same in each row?</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>pipelines. Includes caching, time frame filtering,
geocode pipeline. Complexity = 3!</p>

<ul>
<li>This stuff should all be separated!?</li>
<li>Info-level logging of errors in processing = wrong level?</li>
<li>Raise plain old <code>Exception</code> if anything goes wrong? Crude.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>polite log formatter. How to log dropped messages. Complexity = 1.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="util">util</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>cache call: Uses Beaker to cache calls. Complexity = 1.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note: caching is controlled with an API config variable.</li>
<li>Note: it looks like this code tries to survive errors
by skipping cache attempt. What kind of errors are expected? As
written, expecting both errors in target function and cache to be
caught...</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>data utils: Use BeautifulSoup to clean up HTML or work with
JSON. Complexity = 2.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note: <code>remove_whitespace</code> does more than its name indicates,
be careful or fix naming.</li>
<li>Several functions here act differently on lists and strings as
input. That's not usually the right way to do things. Recommend
cleanup.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>HTTP Utils. Define <code>HttpUtils</code>. Internally (?) defines
<code>RequestAdapter</code> a subclass of <code>HTMLAdapter</code>. Complexity = 1.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note: Dispatch on explicitly queried types. Conversion between
&quot;snake case&quot; and &quot;camel case&quot; is happening here. Why??</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Object Hash: Maintains an on-disk pickled hash table in
<code>/tmp/hashes</code>. Complexity = 1.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note: provides a way to compute the hash value of an object but
does not automatically use this value when making the hash
table (neither key nor value)?</li>
<li>Note: reading the whole table from disk each time can't be a
good idea in <code>set</code>. Recommend fix or delete this part of the
codebase.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Switchable Decorator: Complexity = 1. Only used in <code>cache_call</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
